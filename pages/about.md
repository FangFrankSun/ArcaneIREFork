# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **David** :wave:,

I'm a 2nd year computer science student at TU Dublin.

I'm also a semi-professional league of legends player. I've reached the top 5,000 players out of almost 3 million on the main European server. I've played for [@X7_Esports](https://twitter.com/X7_Esports) in the UKEL, [@wizardggez](https://twitter.com/wizardggez) in Telialigaen and [@LionscreedGG](https://twitter.com/LionsCreedGG) in the NLC.

In my spare time I enjoy cooking and reading :)
